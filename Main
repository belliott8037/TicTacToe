/*
    Make a game of Tic-Tac-Toe asking for heads/tails for a coin flip to see who goes first.
    based on who goes first the computer will randomly choose a spot
    After a turn is made the system will print out what the board looks like
    Game is finished once the board is filled with no winner, or someone gets 3 in a row.
